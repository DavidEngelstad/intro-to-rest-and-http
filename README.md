## Major Concepts

#### Request-Response Cycle

#### REST

REST stands for Representational State Transfer. Okay great, but what exactly does that mean?

REST is an architectural style that makes use of a combination of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to standardize communication between clients and servers (or even servers and servers) across the web.

HTTP is the underlying ruleset for exchanging data between computers. It takes the form of a request-response cycle, as described above.

A URL is the address of a resource that can be located on the web. We can examine the following URL to explore this idea of resources on the web:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/671118/what-exactly-is-restful-programming). This is a link to the questions section of Stack Overflow. It would be reasonable to assume that the number located in the middle of the URL may be some sort of unique identifier. Finally, the last portion of the url describes the question we are viewing on Stack Overflow.

Let's illustrate this with an analogy of sorts. 

#### Node.js

[http module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/http.html)
[url module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/url.html)
[path module](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v8.x/docs/api/path.html)
